# weather-app
This app is made with React.js
I am using OpenWeather api to fetch data about weather. 
The icons are React icons.
I have sourced images for my dynamic background on Shutterstock, where pictures are free to use even commercionally (are copyright free).

This is what the app looks like so far:

You have option to choose from the list of Slovak cities.

And also you have an option to type your desired city an clicking enter.

You can change units from metric to imperial and vice versa by clicking the button

I have these background that change depending on temperature. I have really hottest, hot, cold and freezing background. 
When the temperature is below 5°C or 41°F (including) the background will be freezing.
When the temperature is below 14°C or 57°F (including) the background will be cold.
When the temperature is below 22°C or 72°F (including) the background will be hot.
When the temperature is over 5°C or 41°F the background will be hottest.

The app is pretty much responsive allowing using it on a smaller devices such as tablets or smartphones.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
